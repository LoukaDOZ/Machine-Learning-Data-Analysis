# Machine-Learning-Data-Analysis

Some exercises of machine learning and data analysis made during my 2nd year of engineering school.
Made with Python and mathplotlib, numpy, pandas, seaborn (and other) libraries.

## House pricing

[See folder](house_pricing/) \
Try to estimate the price of houses with machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor.

## Wine quality

[See folder](wine_quality/) \
[See report (french)](wine_quality/report.pdf) \
Mathematical exercise to try to estimate the quality of wines without algorithm. \
Results are compared with machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, LogisticRegression, Descision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and KN Neighborg Classifier.
